        I've always been fascinated by the power that programmers have brought
        to us in both small as well as monumental, almost unfathomable, ways; My
        admiration for those people, coupled with a long-time appreciation for
        narrative and design has shaped my interests in such a way that my end
        goal is to design applications that I can share with others, to do my
        little part in getting people excited about something I've been able to
        take from my mind into a real, appreciable form.
      </h5>
      <h5>
        In order to reach that goal I've spent the past 8 years (and counting)
        picking up all the skills necessary to create, because as much as I'd
        love to just throw my ideas out there and have someone else create
        things for me, part of the thrill is getting to gain a multitude of
        skills, and perspectives as I make incremental headway towards my goals.
      </h5>
      <h5>
        My weakest areas are art and sound design, thankfully my wife is a
        wonderful artist, there are plentiful resources online for free (or
        cheap) and eventually--given a measure of success--I can turn small
        projects and apps into larger realizations of my dreams.
      </h5>
      <h5>
        I know that for every success story, there are thousands of failures; So
        long as I push forward, doing something related to my goals every single
        day, eventually, even if I don't see success, I'll still be learning;
        and someday something I've learned will drive me to success, or prove
        useful to somebody out there, and I'll be able to help them realize
        their dreams.
