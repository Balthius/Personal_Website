      <p>
        I&apos;ve always been fascinated by the power that programmers have
        brought to us in both small as well as monumental, almost unfathomable,
        ways; My admiration for those people, coupled with a long-time
        appreciation for narrative and design has shaped my interests in such a
        way that my end goal is to design applications that I can share with
        others, to do my little part in getting people excited about something
        I&apos;ve been able to take from my mind into a real, appreciable form.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to reach that goal I&apos;ve spent the past 8 years,and
        counting, picking up all the skills necessary to create, because as much
        as I&apos;d love to just throw my ideas out there and have someone else
        create things for me, part of the thrill is getting to gain a multitude
        of skills, and perspectives as I make incremental headway towards my
        goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        My weakest areas are art and sound design, thankfully my wife is a
        wonderful artist, there are plentiful resources online for free, or
        cheap, and eventually--given a measure of success--I can turn small
        projects and apps into larger realizations of my dreams.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know that for every success story, there are thousands of failures; So
        long as I push forward, doing something related to my goals every single
        day, eventually, even if I don&apos;t see success, I&apos;ll still be
        learning; and someday something I&apos;ve learned will drive me to
        success, or prove useful to somebody out there, and I&apos;ll be able to
        help them realize their dreams.
